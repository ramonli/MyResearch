To implement a customized name space handler, you must prepare two files with dedicated name which located under META-INF,
* spring.handlers - which defines the name space handler(handler implementation will register a bean definition parser to your name space).
* spring.schemas - which will point to a xml schema file, which restrict the format of your name space.
